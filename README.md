# MillionJS Test

## Different in performance on big amount of nodes with [millionjs auto mode](https://million.dev/docs/automatic.en-US), [millionjs manual mode](https://million.dev/docs/manual-mode/manual-mode.en-US) and just clean react

In folder **performance_stats** you can find performance test details and results for each mode from chrome dev tools performance tab
